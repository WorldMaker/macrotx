<h1>Welcome to the Macro Transaction Force HQ!</h1>

<p>The building secretary robot eyeballs you just enough to feel like
it knows everything about you, audibly sighs, and then presses an intercom
button on its button-covered chest, not even bothering to try to catch
your name.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gravel?" the robot mechanically chirps to itself. You cannot
hear the reply, only the robot continuing to itself, "You had an interview
scheduled this space afternoon?" The robot nods in frustration, presumably
while Mr. Gravel on the other end of the intercom remembers his agenda for
the day. "Well, <em>she</em>'s here&hellip;" The tone of the robot's pronoun
choice sounds rather condescending for a machine.</p>
