<h1>Welcome to the Macro Transaction Force HQ!</h1>

<p>
  The building secretary robot eyeballs you just enough to feel like it knows
  everything about you, audibly sighs, and then presses an intercom button on
  its button-covered chest, not even bothering to try to catch your name.
</p>

<p>
  "Mr. Gravel?" the robot mechanically chirps to itself. You cannot hear the
  reply, only the robot continuing to itself, "You had an interview scheduled
  this space afternoon?" The robot nods in frustration, presumably while Mr.
  Gravel on the other end of the intercom remembers his agenda for the day.
  "Well, <em>she</em>'s here&hellip;" The tone of the robot's pronoun choice
  sounds rather condescending for a machine.

<hr />

<p data-bind="visible: game().pronoun() == 'she'">
  You don't bother to correct the robot's pronoun usage, but you do give some
  wicked side-eye for its choice of tone.
</p>

<p data-bind="visible: game().pronoun() == 'he'">
  "HE" you loudly point out to the robot. The robot huffs into its intercom,
  "<em>He</em> is here&hellip;".
</p>

<p data-bind="visible: game().pronoun() == 'they'">
  "I'm sorry, but it is 'they'&hellip;" you politely try to correct the robot.
  The robot glares at you and snarks back to the intercom, "They
  <em>is</em> here&hellip;".
</p>

<p>"Mr. Gravel will see you in a few moments," the robot comes back to you.</p>

      In addition to the robot's rudeness, you finally notice the robot wears
