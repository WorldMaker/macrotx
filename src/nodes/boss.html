<h1>Boss Stage!</h1>

<p>Just as you utter the words, "I'm full of passion," the entire space
station begins to shudder and shake. Very quickly a large laser beam blasts
through station walls incinerating Mr. Gravel where he sat at his desk.
Your emergency space suit activates just in time as the oxygen levels start
to fall in the station.</p>

<p>Through the hole in the hull of the station a giant, cyborg in top to bottom
unrevealing power armor flies in, sealing the hole with a flick of the wrist
while passing. You quickly recognize the emblem as the symbol for <em>The
Elucidator</em>. She is one of the most rogue of the Macro Transaction Force's
rogue's gallery.</p>

<p>You can feel The Elucidator's scanning beam examing you, and you prepare
your <span data-bind="text: game().weapon">…</span> for a possible fight.</p>

repeating those steps at least two more times.</p>

<p>"Would you mind a cup of tea, Ms. The Elucidator?" you ask cordially.</p>

<p>Removing her helmet it becomes clear that The Elucidator is a fellow
<span data-bind="text: game().race">…</span>, which you never would have
guessed. She nods patiently and sits down in Mr. Gravel's slightly scorched
chair. Presumably she was unworried about the bits and pieces of Mr. Gravel
between her power armor and the chair.</p>

<p>You prepare a couple cups of tea.
<span data-bind="visible: game().className() == 'Chef'">You manage to collect
a couple biscotti from an emergency chef pouch and even work a small number
of spaceberries into an impromptu spaceberry jam.</span>
The Elucidator smiles a broad smile, "Here to try to fill one of the
Macro Transaction Force's diversity quotas?"</p>

<p>Although unhappy with how blunt she was, you could only admit that
she might have a point, "Seemed that way."</p>

<p>"Getting the full spiel? Passion to save the galaxy from itself?
Long hours, terrible pay, no free time?" She sips, a sly smile on her lips.</p>

<p>You shrug, "We were working towards that. What is it to you?"</p>

<p>"What has Macro Transaction Force done for <i>us</i> lately?"</p>
