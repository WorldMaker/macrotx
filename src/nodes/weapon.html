<p class="list-group-item-text">Mr. Gravel has clearly seen your extensive
portfolio, detailed resume, years of study at respected institutions, and
talked to at least a few of your many references. Does it really take
8 hours to prove that you aren't a liar with a giant ability to pull off
a major conspiracy that will pass even the strictest of background
checks?</p>

<p>"That sounds exciting," you say, thinking about the upcoming 8 space
hours for testing.</p>

<p>Mr. Gravel nodded in that manner that clearly showed that he would not
put up with anything less than excited for mandatory testing. "I like that
passion. The Macro Transaction Force was founded on passion. When you spend
60 to 80 hours per space week working for the force you have to make sure
that everyone shares the same passions. The team is so important to the
galaxy!"</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text">Why can't there be a reasonable work-life
balance? Passion is no substitute for having a full life with friends
outside work, maybe a family, and even some personal time.</p>
